When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

   BP: When working within a team on the same project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

BP: This approach keeps the local files in a consistent order, 
no surprise files can appear unknowinglly, due to work of other team members, I guess...
