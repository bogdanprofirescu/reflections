When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

   BP: When working within a team on the same project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

BP: This approach keeps the local files in a consistent order, 
no surprise files can appear unknowinglly, due to work of other team members, I guess...

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one 
instead of another?

BP: 
* forks is used when one wants to continue the work of others without changing their original work;
* clone makes a copy the online github repository on the local computer
* branches allows working on a number of features while other team members work on other features;
leter the branches can be combined

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

BP: the copy can be kept unaltered?

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? 
What would be easier, and what would be harder?

BP: I would do my best not to use this tool if possible
