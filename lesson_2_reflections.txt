What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

BP: a hidden folder is created by GIT and GIT is ready to receive the "commited"
files

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

BP: Staging area is an intermediate "space" before the repository, it allows the
files to be temporarely stored there before commiting them, allowing to make
modifications (add-remove files) before commiting.

In case of complex projects with a multitude of files it might be usefull.

working dierectory is the phisical location of the folder where the files are.
