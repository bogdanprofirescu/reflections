How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    BP: the differences helped sport the typo

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    BP:Much easier and faster debuging, plus the benefit of the observing the
     behaviour of code when some parts of it change.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    BP: automatic saving makes is more reliable but it will not do the thinking
    for the programmer, that is it will not save when is relevant to save but
    based on a rule;

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    BP: these are different tools for different purposes, for coding makes sense
     to save all the file that make the app working at the same time while
     when working in office one works on a single file at the the time in most
     cases.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    BP: get the ids of all commints and afterwards the differences between any
    2 commits by using the git diff command

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    BP: one could try various approaches without fearing that damages might
    occur give the possibility to revert easily to older versions.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    BP: will try to use it for my Front End Development course.
